# DeepHolo
This project implements an Autoencoder to achieve fast calculation of phase-only hologram. The encoder part implements a U-Net to transform the input image to hologram; the decoder part is the diffraction model that transform hologram back to image. The loss is VGG perceptual loss. The data set is Pokemon images.
